# Modelling the Green Transition Through a Simple IO-SFC Model

---

## Overview

This repository accompanies the keynote speech delivered at the Summer School on *Multiscale Modeling and Ecological Macroeconomics* (8-10 September 2025, University of Florence, Italy). It presents a prototype hybrid model that integrates Input-Output (IO) analysis with Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) modelling to assess ecological transition strategies in a macroeconomic framework.

## Abstract

The shift towards an ecologically sustainable economic system necessitates robust modelling tools that capture the intricate interplay among financial, economic, social, and ecological variables. In my speech, I will explore the integration of insights from Input-Output (IO) models with Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) models as a promising methodological approach for simulating and assessing green transition strategies. IO models have traditionally been employed to map inter-industry relationships and quantify resource flows, while SFC models provide a dynamic framework that ensures consistency in the stock and flow dynamics within both the economy and the ecosystem. Despite their complementary strengths, these two modelling approaches have largely evolved in isolation. By synthesising insights from recent literature, I will argue that hybrid IO-SFC models offer a powerful tool for understanding the macroeconomic implications of the green transition. I will present the main features of a prototype IO-SFC model designed to simulate green innovations in a single-area economy, highlighting its ability to address cross-industry interdependencies and environmental impacts. The model will be grounded in a broadly defined post-Keynesian theoretical framework in which money is endogenously created, production is demand-driven, and industries utilise the labour force and intermediate products to produce final goods while generating waste and emissions and depleting natural resources. Through this integrated approach, I will underscore how IO-SFC models can provide a broader perspective on the socio-economic and environmental outcomes of green policies.
